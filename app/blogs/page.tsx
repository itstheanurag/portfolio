          Here’s where I share what I learn, what I build, and what excites me
          in the world of technology. Consider this a peek into my notes,
          experiments, and creative ideas. You’ll find everything from deep
          technical dives to quick tips and personal insights—crafted to help,
          inspire, and spark curiosity.
