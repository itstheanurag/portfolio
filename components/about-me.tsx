            I like working on things that are interesting and slightly difficult.
            When a problem grabs my attention, it stays with me. I keep turning it
            over until it makes sense and eventually works the way it should.

            If someone is paying me to do a job, then doing it properly is my responsibility and that is my motivation. I am happy to work with others. In my past work places i was a team player. Even if some kind of conflict did arise, it never affected my work.

            I&apos;m more of a do more, talk less kind of person. Instead of spending
            months perfecting theory, I use modern tools, including AI, to build
            useful and interesting things faster. I don&apos;t claim to know everything inside out when it comes to building software. But i am confident that i can figure it out.
